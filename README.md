# Product-api

You need to come-up with open ended LLD and write a code for the below problem statement.

 Design an e-commerce backend – 

       ·       User should be able to see products in different way. (Ex: The service to be designed and developed needs to return back products!

       ·       Seller should be able to post products. 

       ·       User should be able to add products to cart. 

       ·       User should be able to place an order by making payment. 

 

 Actions you can assume – 

·       User has already an account. 

·       Seller has already an account. 

·       Both can login to system. 

Solution should cover on the below segments:

    low level design
    Architecture and data model
    No need to build any UI components REST/Event any protocol would do.
